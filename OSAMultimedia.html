      A controversial topic present in today's world is human enhancement. Human enhancement increases the abilities of people. Performance improving drugs and cosmetic surgery are the two more accepted forms of human enhancement, but biotechnical and genetic modification are the Human Enhancement issues with the greatest moral issues.

      Biotechnical engineering is generally used for repairing or replacing body parts that cannot normally be repaired naturally using prosthetics and electronics.  Genetic modification is more prominently unnatural as it directly affects a human's genes.

      The main results of genetic modification are to have added, changed, or deleted DNA from an organism. The most recent and efficient tool is called CRISPR-Cas9. This tool attaches RNA (a genetic material like DNA), to the part of DNA that is to be affected. After it is attached, it attaches Cas9 to cut the DNA. Finally, machinery is used to make changes to the organism’s genes while the DNA repairs.

      A somatic genetic modification is when it is applied to an already existing person. A somatic genetic modification is used to rid organisms of medical conditions by affecting part of a person’s cells. It is used very occasionally in people.

      Germline genetic modification is when it is applied to an egg, sperm, or early embryo. The modification to the cell would be applied to every cell after the organism grows and any further offspring created from the organism. Germline genetic modification is banned in many countries and has not been used on humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somatic and germline genetic modification have several different uses. Somatic genetic modification is generally used for dealing with diseases after they’ve affected an organism’s cells. Germline genetic modification could be used as it is used in plants and animals where it is used to prevent diseases and engineer healthy genes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst there are many positive uses of genetic modification, there are certain effects genetic modification will have if implemented wrongly. As it stands, genetic modification in humans is to be used for treating and preventing diseases. Additionally, genetic modification will strictly be used for somatic genetic modification as germline genetic modification causes long-term consequences in the affected person’s future offspring.
